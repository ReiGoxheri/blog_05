            <p>A blockchain is like a super safe digital diary. It writes down who gives what to whom, but nobody can erase or cheat because lots of computers watch over it together.
            Think of a blockchain as a special online notebook. It keeps track of who gives money to others. Once something is written, it can't be changed, making it really fair and trustworthy.</p>

            <p>Robotic technology is like smart machines. These machines can do tasks by themselves, like your robot toys. They listen to instructions and can even learn new things, making our lives easier and more fun.
            Robotic technology is all about clever robots. These robots can do jobs on their own, just like the ones you see in movies. They follow commands and can figure out things, helping us with tasks and making the world more exciting.</p>
